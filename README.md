# Pokemon Trainer Gym
## Worked with a partner to create a website that displays Pokemon information from the Pokemon API using two Javascript libraries that we created.

## Tools Used:
* CSS
* Javascript
* AJAX

## Features:
* Each partner stored Pokemon API data in three pokemon objects, then pushed them into a trainer object in the previous project.
* Accessed the two trainer objects for this project by using a callback function.
* The design of the website is simple, inuitive and it uses color to highlight the different pokemon.
